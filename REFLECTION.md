I noticed that most of the testing went as expected, and it was nice not needing to specify the datatype like in other languages. I had a few predictions that were incorrect, like when dividing by 0 returned Infinity instead of NaN. I thought it would return NaN, like undefined. None of the functions were too difficult, but I'd say isEven() was slightly easier to figure out than isOdd(), and I initially ran into some issues trying to test the functions out with Node.js. For instance, the multiply() function required 2 arguments, so I needed to initialized 2 const variables for that. This toolkit could be useful for performing repeated math functions. For instance, maybe it would be useful for something related to accounting or computer graphics.

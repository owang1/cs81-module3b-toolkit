I predict the double(n) function will return double the number I give it. I'm planning to use console.log() and enter a number like 5, and expecting to get 10. Then I'll use Node.js to test the JavaScript file from the terminal.

I predict the square() function will return the square of the number I give it. For instance, entering 5 should give 25, and -5 should give 25.

I predict the double(n) function will return double the number I give it. I'm planning to use console.log() and enter a number like 5, and expecting to get 10. Then I'll use Node.js to test the JavaScript file from the terminal.

I predict the square() function will return the square of the number I give it. For instance, entering 5 should give 25, and -5 should give 25.

I predict the isEven() function will return a boolean True when the number entered is even, and False when it is odd.

I predict isOdd() will return the opposite true / false results to isEven. It should be true when the number is odd, false when it is even.
